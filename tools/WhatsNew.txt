==========
The update comes with serveral new features and some improvements to existing tools.

BIOS files for all supported systems can be selected now. For casual users this can help
to improve the authenticity of the emulated system. But also developers can benefit from it
because they can test if their rom will be rejected by the BIOS. Additionally, the state
of the system after the BIOS will be faithfully reproduced. Appropriate BIOS files
can be found on the web.

The Master Everdrive and the Everdrive GG can be emulated now. This feature as well can help
to improve the authenticity of the emulated system. Developers can test if their rom is
compatible with an Everdrive and also the state of the system after the Everdrive will be
faithfully reproduced. To enable Everdrive emulation you need an Everdrive OS file. These can
be found on the official website of the Everdrive. You can select a 1bpp font to use with
the Everdrive but you can also let Emulicious derive a 1bpp font from the system font.
Recent versions of the Everdrive OS come with their own font. They ignore the selected font.

The Memory Editor got expanded by a context menu and its interaction with the Debugger
has been improved. Table files can now be manually selected in the Memory Editor and symbol
files can now be manually selected in the Debugger. Furthermore, the Memory Editor now supports
multi-selection and copy&paste. The Coverage Analyzer also got expanded by a context menu.
It allows to exclude selected addresses from the analysis or to reset the collected data
for selected addresses.

==========
2016-12-04
==========
The update comes with some improvements to existing tools and also introduces new tools.

Improvements
------------
The disassembler now also identifies accesses to ports and creates labels for them as well.
Profiler data is now persisted between runs of Emulicious.
When hovering a sprite in the Sprite Editor it now also gets highlighted in the main window.
New errors have been added to expressions that should help with writing correct expressions.

Savestates
----------
Savestates can now be used with hotkeys. The number keys 1-9 load the savestate from
the corresponding slot. Holding the CTRL key while pressing the number keys saves into
the corresponding slot. If you accidentally loaded a state instead of saving to it you
can just undo the load and return to the state before loading. The same works for saving.
If you accidentally saved into a slot that you wanted to keep you can just undo the save.
You can also quick save using CTRL+S and load the quicksave using CTRL+Q.
Furthermore, you can setup Emulicious to automatically load the most recent state when a
rom is loaded. You can also steup Emulicious to automatically save the current state on exit.

New tools
---------
A RAM Search tool (also known as Cheat Search) has been added to Emulicious. It filters
RAM addresses based on the comparison of the current value with its previous value. It helps
to identify variables within RAM such as the number of lives, the current position, and so on.
A plotter has been added that can plot the data of a specified range in ROM. It can help to
identify tables such as sine/cosine tables or other pattern data.
A RAM Watch tool has been added. It keeps track of the values of specified
variables / values in RAM and plots them.

==========
2016-06-17
==========
Finally the tools previously only available for the Master System and the Game Gear
are now also available for the Game Boy and Game Boy Color. That means that all the
viewers, i.e., the Palette Viewer, the Tile Viewer, the Tilemap Viewer and the Sprite
Viewer are now also available for the Game Boy and the Game Boy Color.
Furthermore, the debugger including the smart disassembler with automated code/data
separation and all of its additional tools are also usable for Game Boy and Game Boy
Color debugging. These additional tools are the Tracer, the Profiler and the Coverage
Analyzer. The only tool that isn't supported for the Game Boy and the Game Boy Color
is the Memory Tracer

Additionally, the accuracy of Game Boy and Game Boy Color emulation has been
improved greatly.

==========
2016-04-29
==========
The update comes with a lot of improvements and additions:
	Performance
	-----------
	- The overall performance has been improved
	- The impact of the debugger on the performance has been reduced significantly
	
	Bugfixes
	--------
	- A bug has been fixed that could cause crashes on Linux based systems
	- A bug has been fixed that could cause Emulicious to run even slower
	  when it couldn't reach 100%

	Additions to Emulation
	----------------------
	- Light Phaser Emulation
	- Emulation 3 and 6 button Mega Drive Controllers

	Additions to Tooling
	--------------------
	- Hovering over a RAM address in the debugger shows its current value
	- The Memory Editor now indicates labels by underlining the corresponding bytes
	- When the Tracer is enabled the debugger now also visualizes the trace
	- Port Watchpoints can now be added in the Breakpoint Window using the prefix 'p'
	  so entering "pdd" would add a port breakpoint on port dd
	- Acompletely new tool has beed added called "Coverage". It records all accesses
	  to any address. It uses different colors to encode relative numbers of accesses.
	  It uses 3 base colors at different levels of brightness. Yellow means it is
	  accessed significantly more often than green and red means it is accessed
	  significantly more often than yellow. The brightness indicates the relation
	  to other values with the same base color. A brighter color means that it has more
	  accesses than the one with the darker color. The Coverage tool can be used to
	  identify hotspots but also to identify dead code, unused data or unused RAM.
	  In conjunction with breakpoints and stepping it can also be used to identify which
	  code/data/ram is used from one point of the execution to another.
	- An overview ruler has been added to the debugger which is a 1 dimensional
	  representation of the whole file of the debugger. It also shows the colors of the
	  tracer and the coverage tool. It can be clicked to directly scroll to the
	  corresponding address

	Misc
	----
	- Patch files can now be loaded like ROM files
	- Screenshots can now be taken by pressing F12

	- Sub-line selections in the debugger have been enabled
	- The disassembler has been made more stable to significantly reduce the number
	  of crashes and freezes caused by it
	- The reference hierarchy has been improved and now also supportes jump
	  table, pointer tables and RAM addresses

==========
2015-06-25
==========
A log has been added to the Breakpoint Window.
All breakpoints that get hi will be logged there. By disabling the checkbox for
"Suspend" you can avoid suspension when breakpoints are hit and only log them instead.

==========
2015-05-17
==========
The update comes with additional options for the tracer and introduces
an outline to the debugger.
The outline helps you navigate through code more easily by providing
a sructured representation of the code. It is directly linked to the
selection of the debugger so it can also help to orient yourself in the code.
The tracer can be controlled using conditions now. You can define conditions
on which to start/end tracing and a condition on which to trace an instruction
at all. Besides that, the tracer allows you to provide an expression to be
evaluated before each instruction being trace. The result of the evaluation is
appended to the trace.
This way you can add additional information to your trace. For example, if you
want to watch the value in RAM at $c000 you can set the expression to "@$c000".
Using this expression each line of your trace will also show you the value at $c000.

==========
2015-04-22
==========
For Windows users that don't have Java installed on their system
an alternative download including Java binaries has been added to
the Downloads section.

The update comes with several new features:
	- The stack now shows labels of the functions that have been
	  called (it can be double-clicked to navigate to the call)
	- The stack now shows the names of the registers that have
	  been stored int it
	- Conditional breakpoints
	- An option for setting uninitialized memory and a breakpoint
	  that suspends execution on access of uninitialized memory
	- A breakpoint that suspends when an interrupt does't restore
	  the state properly (Break on inconsistent state after interrupt)
	- Emulation of PAL for the SEGA Master System
	- Emulation of the screen borders of the SEGA Master System
	- Options to unhide the offscreen area of the SEGA Game Gear
	- DATA labels in the Z80 disassembler
	- RAM labels in the Z80 disassembler

Z80 disassembler / Master System disassembler
---------------------------------------------

The Z80 disassembler / Master System disassembler has been improved
to create DATA labels for data that is referenced. This can help to
identify blocks of data. It now also creates RAM labels that can help to
determine RAM usage and variable sizes

Expressions/conditions support the following
--------------------------------------------

arithmetic operators: +, -
boolean/logical operators: &, |
shift operators: <<, >>
compare operators: =, ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=
decimal numbers
hex numbers (prefixed by either $ or 0x)
binary numbers (prefixed by %)
symbols loaded from a symfile
variables (see below)
the @ operator to "read" a value from a calculated address.

Besides that, the following variables are supported:

All register names. As single registers and as register pairs.
va (the current vdp address)
scanline (the current scanline)
address (the current address)
bank0 (the bank in slot 0)
bank1 (the bank in slot 1)
bank2 (the bank in slot 2)

For read/write watchpoints only:
value (the value being read/written)
source (the address being read/written)

For write watchpoints only:
oldvalue (the value being overwritten)

==========
2015-02-09
==========
The new version extends the debugger with a Find Dialog and helps
you track the control flow by highlighting the trace of the
instructions being executed. A Reference Hierarchy has been added
that lists all references to a specified label.

When hovering a control flow instruction its destination will be
highlighted now and when it is clicked while holding the CTRL key
the debugger will be scrolled to its destination.

==========
2014-12-07
==========
With this new version you can finally enjoy your favorite games
in fullscreen! You can enter fullscreen by either pressing
ALT+ENTER or from the Graphics menu.

The debugger has been extended by watchpoints (aka memory
breakpoints) that will suspend execution on a read/write of a
specified memory location.

The memory editor has been extended by a find dialog that allows
searching the memory. Besides that the memory editor now supports
simple table files.
